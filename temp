1. Left-Bank Hetmanate Autonomy (1687–1764) Key Stages and Causes 1687: Galician Articles signed Cause 1 – Moscow’s desire for institutionalized control: The Tsardom of Moscow sought to formalize its influence over Ukrainian Cossacks after Khmelnytsky’s Pereyaslav Treaty. The Galician Articles made the Hetmanate pledge military support and tribute. Cause 2 – Cossack elite’s fear of Polish return: After years of warfare, many Cossack leaders viewed Moscow as the lesser evil compared to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Cause 3 – Weakness of Ukrainian central authority: Internal divisions and lack of unified leadership made local elites more likely to accept Muscovite patronage for security. 1708–1709: Mazepa’s revolt and the Battle of Poltava Cause 1 – Mazepa’s fear of Russian centralization: Peter the Great’s growing intervention in Hetmanate affairs (e.g., fortification seizures, quartering of troops) led Mazepa to view Sweden as a more flexible ally. Cause 2 – Swedish military strength: Charles XII of Sweden’s success in earlier campaigns (e.g., Battle of Narva, 1700) made alliance appealing. Cause 3 – Alienation of Ukrainian elites: Peter’s imposition of new taxes and conscription policies antagonized traditional Cossack structures. Battle of Poltava (June 27, 1709): A decisive Russian victory over Sweden and Mazepa’s Cossacks; marked the decline of Swedish influence and Mazepa’s hopes for independence. Mazepa fled to Ottoman territory. 1764: Abolition of Hetmanate Cause 1 – Catherine II’s centralization policies: Catherine saw multiple jurisdictions as inefficient and subversive. Cause 2 – Integration of Ukrainian elite: Many starshyna were granted Russian noble status, decreasing the need for Cossack structures. Cause 3 – Fears of separatism: The memory of Mazepa’s revolt remained vivid; autonomous institutions were seen as dangerous. Key Individuals Ivan Mazepa (1639–1709) Educated in Jesuit colleges in Poland and Italy; served in Polish and Russian courts. Hetman of the Left Bank (1687–1708), supporter of Peter the Great until tensions over centralization arose. Defected to Charles XII of Sweden; posthumously vilified by Russia, but regarded as a hero by Ukrainian nationalists. Oleksiy Rozumovsky (1709–1771) Ukrainian-born noble, brother of Hetman Kyrylo Rozumovsky. Used his court connections (through Empress Elizabeth) to promote Cossack interests. Although not a hetman himself, he influenced the brief restoration of the title in 1750–1764 before it was abolished. 2. Peter the Great (1682–1725) Policy Objectives and Motivations Westernization Cause 1 – Military inferiority to Europe: Defeats by the Ottomans and Swedes revealed Russia’s need for modernization. Cause 2 – Economic underdevelopment: Peter sought to build new industries, especially for military supply. Cause 3 – Desire for recognition: He wanted Russia to be seen as a peer to European monarchies. Hetmanate Policy Cause 1 – Strategic importance of Ukraine: Ukraine’s fertile land and location made it vital for logistics in war against Sweden and Turkey. Cause 2 – Mazepa’s betrayal: Justified tighter control and elimination of autonomous privileges. Cause 3 – Centralization ideology: Peter believed that sovereignty could not be shared with regional leaders. Great Northern War (1700–1721) Cause 1 – Russia’s desire for Baltic access: Control of ports was essential for trade and naval power. Cause 2 – Swedish dominance in Northern Europe: Charles XII controlled Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and parts of Poland. Cause 3 – Formation of anti-Swedish coalition: Russia allied with Poland-Lithuania and Denmark-Norway. Key Battles: Battle of Narva (1700) – Swedish victory over Russia. Battle of Lesnaya (1708) – Russian victory against Swedish supply corps. Battle of Poltava (1709) – Decisive Russian victory; broke Swedish power in the east. Peter the Great – Mini Biography Born in 1672, son of Tsar Alexis. Became sole ruler in 1696; led Grand Embassy to Western Europe (1697–1698). Introduced sweeping military, naval, and bureaucratic reforms. Reorganized church under state control; created new capital, St. Petersburg. 3. Catherine the Great (1762–1796) Imperial Policies and Motivations Final Liquidation of the Hetmanate (1764) Cause 1 – Bureaucratic Rationalization: Catherine sought to streamline governance. The Hetmanate's autonomous structures clashed with imperial uniformity. Cause 2 – Legacy of Mazepa’s Rebellion: Ongoing suspicion of Ukrainian autonomy made local self-rule politically suspect. Cause 3 – Economic Integration Goals: Integration allowed the extraction of resources, tax revenues, and military service. Equalization of Starshyna with Russian Nobility (1785) Cause 1 – Co-optation of Local Elite: Catherine needed to reward and secure loyalty from the Ukrainian gentry. Cause 2 – Reinforcing Social Hierarchy: This policy aligned local leadership with Russian imperial ideology. Cause 3 – Displacement of Cossack Military Tradition: The nobility privileges substituted the Cossack service-based model. Enslavement of Peasants and Codification of Serfdom Cause 1 – Increased Agricultural Demand: Expansion of grain trade required stable, controllable rural labor. Cause 2 – Political Support from Nobility: Consolidating power required appeasing landowners. Cause 3 – Dismantling of Cossack and Peasant Liberties: Enserfment erased the last vestiges of peasant mobility and Cossack autonomy. Russo-Turkish Wars 1768–1774 War Key Battles: Battle of Larga (July 7, 1770) – Russian victory under Rumyantsev. Battle of Kagul (July 21, 1770) – Crushing Russian victory. Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774): Russia gained access to the Black Sea and nominal control over Crimea. 1787–1792 War Key Battles: Siege of Ochakov (1788) – Russian victory after prolonged siege. Battle of Focșani (1789) – Joint Russian-Austrian victory. Treaty of Jassy (1792): Confirmed annexation of territory up to the Dniester. Partitions of Poland 1772, 1793, 1795 Cause 1 – Polish Political Instability: Weak elective monarchy and foreign interference. Cause 2 – Strategic Expansion Goals: Russia, Prussia, and Austria sought to redraw the Eastern European map. Cause 3 – Opportunity to Secure Orthodox Populations: Justified expansion as protection of Orthodox Christians. Consequence: Right-Bank Ukraine (Volhynia, Podolia, Kyiv) absorbed into Russian Empire. Catherine the Great – Mini Biography Born as Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (1729); married future Tsar Peter III. Seized power via a coup in 1762 with elite and military support. Patron of Enlightenment, yet reinforced autocracy and serfdom. Oversaw Russia’s transformation into a major imperial power. Died in 1796; succeeded by her son Paul I. 4. Russian Empire in the Early 19th Century Economic and Political System Cause 1 – Continued Serfdom: Serfdom remained the backbone of the rural economy, binding millions of peasants to noble estates. This stifled mobility, innovation, and agrarian productivity. Cause 2 – Autocracy and Censorship: The Romanov dynasty ruled with absolute power. Political dissent was suppressed by a vast bureaucracy and the Third Section (secret police). Cause 3 – Military Dominance: The empire prioritized military strength over civic development. The army was both a symbol of imperial might and a mechanism for social control. “Little Russian Mentality” A worldview among the Ukrainian elite that accepted subordination to the Russian Empire in exchange for privileges. Cause 1 – Integration of Starshyna into Russian Nobility: These former Cossack elites were granted estates and status, incentivizing assimilation. Cause 2 – Absence of State Institutions: Without Ukrainian state structures, elites relied on imperial frameworks. Cause 3 – Russian Cultural Policy: Russification campaigns downplayed Ukrainian identity, encouraging loyalty to a greater Russian identity. 5. Alexander II (1855–1881) Abolition of Serfdom (1861) Cause 1 – Military Failures in Crimea: Russia’s loss to Britain, France, and the Ottomans in the Crimean War (1853–1856) highlighted the inefficiency of a serf-based system. Cause 2 – Economic Modernization Pressure: Industrialization required a mobile labor force, impossible under serfdom. Cause 3 – Social Unrest: Growing peasant discontent, frequent uprisings, and intellectual critiques pressured reform. Reform Contents: Serfs gained personal freedom and allotments of land (often small and overpriced). Former landlords were compensated through government bonds. Redemption payments locked peasants into debt for decades. Other Major Reforms Judicial Reform: Introduced trial by jury and independent courts (1864). Zemstvo Reform: Created local self-governments responsible for education, infrastructure, and health. Military Reform: Reduced service from 25 to 6 years; expanded training and modernized equipment. Impact on Ukraine Peasants in Left and Right Bank Ukraine gained formal freedom, but remained economically vulnerable. Zemstvos provided some space for Ukrainian civic initiatives, but Ukrainian language and culture were still suppressed in public education and print. Alexander II – Mini Biography Born in 1818, son of Nicholas I. Became emperor in 1855 during the Crimean War. Known as the “Tsar Liberator” for emancipating the serfs. Survived multiple assassination attempts before being fatally wounded in 1881 by Narodnaya Volya. His death halted reform and triggered a wave of repression under Alexander III. 6. Austrian Empire and Western Ukraine (Late 18th – Early 20th Centuries) Habsburg Policy and Reforms Cause 1 – Administrative Modernization: Joseph II implemented centralized policies to streamline the empire, including reforms in Galicia. Cause 2 – Enlightenment Ideals: Legal equality, secularization, and education were promoted. Cause 3 – Response to National Movements: Polish nobility and rising Ukrainian nationalism led Vienna to play them off against each other. Impact: Serfs gained partial freedoms (1780s). Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church received state recognition. Education expanded, especially among clergy and peasants. Revolution of 1848–1849 in Galicia Cause 1 – Liberal Wave Across Europe: Revolutions broke out in France, Germany, Italy, and the Habsburg lands. Cause 2 – Polish Nationalism: Polish nobility demanded autonomy; Viennese authorities feared Polish control. Cause 3 – Ukrainian Mobilization: Ukrainian intellectuals formed the Supreme Ruthenian Council, seeking language rights and territorial separation from Poles. Outcome: Austrian authorities suppressed both Polish and Ukrainian autonomy. Poles were given control of local administration; Ukrainians were marginalized. Cultural Consequences Western Ukraine became a center of Ukrainian cultural revival. Lviv (Lemberg) emerged as the hub of Ukrainian literary and scholarly life. Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood (Kyiv) and Shevchenko Scientific Society (Lviv) spread national consciousness. 7. World War I (1914–1918) and Ukraine Key Characteristics and Causes Cause 1 – Strategic Location: Ukraine's territory, especially Galicia and Bukovina, lay on the front line between Austria-Hungary and Russia. Cause 2 – Competing National Claims: Both Russians and Austrians saw Ukrainians as vital to their war aims; Austria hoped to cultivate loyalty in Galicia, Russia aimed to assimilate it. Cause 3 – Ethnic and Political Complexity: Ukrainians were divided between empires—those in the Russian Empire were treated with suspicion, while those in Austria-Hungary were caught between Polish and imperial dominance. Major Battles Involving Ukrainian Lands Battle of Galicia (August–September 1914): Russian victory; Galicia briefly occupied. Brusilov Offensive (June–September 1916): Russian breakthrough across the front including Volhynia and Galicia; tactical success but strategically inconclusive. Impact Massive civilian displacement and famine. Rise of Ukrainian national consciousness, particularly among soldiers and refugees. Collapse of Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires by war’s end created power vacuum. 8. Ukrainian Revolution (1917–1921) 8.1 Central Rada and the Four Universals Cause 1 – Collapse of Imperial Authority: Russian February Revolution left a vacuum in Ukraine. Cause 2 – Rising Ukrainian National Movement: Cultural and political elites demanded autonomy. Cause 3 – Threat of Russian Centralism: Provisional Government in Petrograd resisted federalism. Four Universals: June 1917: Autonomy within a federated Russia. July 1917: Expansion of authority but still within Russia. November 1917: Ukrainian People’s Republic proclaimed. January 1918: Full independence declared. 8.2 Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadsky (April–December 1918) Cause 1 – German Military Occupation: Post-Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Germany installed Skoropadsky. Cause 2 – Elite Conservatism: Former imperial officers and landlords supported stability. Cause 3 – Peasant Resistance: Skoropadsky’s rollback of land reforms alienated the peasantry. Skoropadsky focused on state-building, education, and bureaucracy but lacked mass support. 8.3 Directorate and Bolshevik Invasions Symon Petliura’s Directorate overthrew Skoropadsky in December 1918. Multiple Bolshevik invasions: 1918, 1919, and 1920. Cause 1 – Bolshevik ambition to control all former imperial lands. Cause 2 – Ukrainian desire to resist both Reds and Whites. Cause 3 – Internal weakness and lack of international support. Treaty of Riga (March 1921): Ends Polish-Soviet War; splits Ukraine—West to Poland, East becomes Ukrainian SSR. 9. Russian Revolutions of 1917 February Revolution Cause 1 – Military Defeats in WWI: Heavy losses and discontent in cities and at the front. Cause 2 – Economic Collapse: Food shortages and inflation. Cause 3 – Political Repression: No mechanisms for peaceful change. Result: Tsar Nicholas II abdicates; Provisional Government formed. October Revolution Cause 1 – Provisional Government’s Failure: Continued war effort and delays in land reform. Cause 2 – Bolshevik Organization: Effective propaganda and military networks (e.g., Red Guards). Cause 3 – Support from Workers and Soldiers: Especially in Petrograd and Moscow. Result: Bolsheviks seize power; begin withdrawing from WWI. 10. Russian Civil War and Ukraine (1918–1922) Key Combatants and Policies Red Army (Bolsheviks): Sought centralized socialist state; implemented War Communism. White Armies: Monarchists and republicans aiming to restore old order. Ukrainians: Fought for independence; often caught between Reds and Whites. Key Battles Capture of Kyiv by Bolsheviks (February 1919) Battle of Pereyaslav (June 1919): Clashes between Petliura’s troops and Red Army. 1920 Kyiv Offensive: Polish-Ukrainian forces briefly took Kyiv before Red counterattack. War Communism Grain requisitioning, suppression of private trade, conscription. Cause 1 – Sustain Red Army Cause 2 – Ideological push for total control Cause 3 – Shortage of industrial goods and currency Reasons for Bolshevik Victory Cause 1 – Better Coordination and Leadership: Trotsky’s organization of the Red Army. Cause 2 – Control of Central Regions: Access to railways and major cities. Cause 3 – White Disunity and Reactionary Policies: Alienated many minorities and peasants. 11. The 1920s in Ukraine and Russia: NEP, Ukrainization, and the USSR New Economic Policy (NEP) Cause 1 – Economic Collapse from War Communism: The economy was in ruins; industry at 20% of prewar levels, widespread famine. Cause 2 – Peasant Revolts: Resistance to forced grain requisitions (e.g., Antonov uprising) led Lenin to soften policies. Cause 3 – Need for Stabilization: The Bolsheviks required time to consolidate power and rebuild infrastructure. Contents: Legalized small private businesses and markets. Agricultural surplus could be sold for profit. State retained control of heavy industry and banks. Ukrainization Policy Cause 1 – Leninist Nationalities Policy: To win support, the Soviet regime promoted non-Russian languages and cultures. Cause 2 – Ukrainian Resistance During Civil War: The Bolsheviks needed to appease nationalist sentiments. Cause 3 – Intellectual Revival: A new generation of Ukrainian writers, educators, and historians emerged. Outcomes: Ukrainian language adopted in schools and administration. Flourishing of Ukrainian literature, theater, and academia. Short-lived autonomy before reversal under Stalin. Formation of the USSR (1922) Cause 1 – Desire to Maintain Imperial Unity Under a New Ideology: USSR replaced Russian Empire with a formally federative but centrally controlled system. Cause 2 – Political Consolidation: Institutionalized Bolshevik control across diverse regions. Cause 3 – International Ambitions: USSR meant to be the nucleus of a future global socialist union. 12. Stalin’s Leadership (1922–1953) Second Revolution (1928–1939): Collectivization and Industrialization Cause 1 – Desire to Rapidly Modernize: Stalin wanted to industrialize the USSR at breakneck speed. Cause 2 – Eliminate Peasant Autonomy: The peasantry’s independent behavior under NEP was seen as a threat. Cause 3 – Ideological Commitment: The Marxist vision required collectivized agriculture and state control. Policies: Forced collectivization: private farms abolished, state-run collectives (kolkhozes) imposed. Grain quotas skyrocketed; resistance met with deportations or executions. Holodomor (1932–1933) Cause 1 – Unrealistic Grain Quotas: Ukraine, as the breadbasket, was overburdened with production demands. Cause 2 – Repression of Nationalism: Ukrainian peasant resistance was interpreted as nationalism. Cause 3 – Political Punishment: Many historians argue the famine was used deliberately to break Ukrainian identity. Death Toll: Estimates range from 3.5 to 7 million. Official Denial: Soviet authorities covered up the famine and denied foreign aid. Great Purges (1936–1938) Targeted Ukrainian elites, writers, and clergy. 80% of the Ukrainian intelligentsia eliminated. Show trials, mass arrests, and Gulag sentences. Stalin’s WWII Role and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939) Pact with Nazi Germany: Secret protocol divided Eastern Europe; USSR invaded Eastern Poland (Western Ukraine). Cause 1 – Delay Conflict with Germany: USSR not ready for war. Cause 2 – Regain Imperial Borders: Lands lost after WWI restored. Cause 3 – Strategic Buffer Zones: Protect western front. Operation Barbarossa (June 22, 1941): Nazi Germany invades USSR, including Ukraine. Stalin – Mini Biography Born Ioseb Dzhugashvili in Georgia, 1878. Rose through Bolshevik ranks; General Secretary in 1922. Dictator by mid-1920s; consolidated power through terror. Architect of Soviet industrialization and repression. Died in 1953; legacy remains deeply polarizing. 13. Western Ukraine under Poland (1920s–1930s) Post-Riga Treaty Integration Western Ukraine (Galicia, Volhynia) absorbed into Second Polish Republic. Polish Policies Toward Ukrainians Cause 1 – National Integration Efforts: Poland sought a homogenous Polish nation-state. Cause 2 – View of Ukrainians as Security Threats: Ukrainian nationalism seen as subversive. Cause 3 – Polish-Ukrainian Historical Rivalry: Longstanding enmities resurfaced. Policies: Closure of Ukrainian schools. Banning of Ukrainian organizations. Colonization by Polish settlers. Rise of Ukrainian Nationalist Organizations OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists) founded in 1929. Influenced by fascism and anti-Polish, anti-Soviet ideologies. Advocated armed struggle for independence. Assassinated Polish officials, such as Interior Minister Bronisław Pieracki (1934). 14. Nazi Occupation of Ukraine (1941–1944) Operation Barbarossa and Initial Reception Many Ukrainians initially welcomed Germans as liberators from Soviet oppression. That illusion quickly dissipated as Nazi brutality escalated. Key Battles in Ukraine Battle of Kyiv (August–September 1941): Major German victory; 600,000 Soviet troops encircled. Battle of Kharkiv (multiple, 1941–1943): City changed hands four times. Battle of Stalingrad (1942–1943): Though not in Ukraine, diverted resources and turned tide against Axis. Occupation Policies Cause 1 – Lebensraum Doctrine: Ukraine was to be colonized by Germans, its population reduced or enslaved. Cause 2 – Racial Ideology: Ukrainians viewed as inferior. Cause 3 – Economic Exploitation: Ukraine’s agriculture and industry pillaged for German war effort. Atrocities: Holocaust (Babi Yar massacre), forced labor, mass starvation. Nazi Internal Disagreements Some officials supported limited Ukrainian autonomy (Abwehr, certain SS officers). Others (e.g., Rosenberg, Hitler) opposed any recognition of Ukrainian nationhood. 15. OUN–UPA Activity in Western Ukraine (1944–1950s) Context and Emergence As the Nazis retreated and the Soviets returned (1944), Ukrainian nationalists resumed resistance—not against Germany, but against Soviet occupation. Key Causes of Continued Armed Struggle Cause 1 – Soviet Repression of National Identity: Arrests, deportations, and forced collectivization in Western Ukraine reignited nationalist resistance. Cause 2 – Betrayal by Nazis and Soviets: Both promised autonomy but ultimately sought to dominate Ukrainian territory. Cause 3 – Legacy of OUN Ideology: The radical wing (OUN-B) led by Stepan Bandera maintained a goal of total independence through armed struggle. UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) Formed by OUN in 1942; turned guns on both Nazi occupiers and Soviet partisans. Most active 1944–1950 in Volhynia, Galicia, and Carpathians. Tactics and Organization Guerrilla warfare: ambushes, sabotage, targeted assassinations of NKVD and Soviet collaborators. Underground support networks provided shelter, food, and intelligence. Soviet Response NKVD deployed tens of thousands of agents and troops. Mass deportations of suspected collaborators (over 500,000 deported by 1952). Use of infiltration and psychological warfare to break resistance. Decline of UPA Key Arrests: Yaroslav Stetsko (OUN), Roman Shukhevych (UPA commander) killed in 1950. By mid-1950s, the movement was crushed, though sympathies persisted underground. 16. Nikita Khrushchev’s Leadership (1953–1964) De-Stalinization and Reforms Cause 1 – Stalin’s Death and Power Vacuum: Khrushchev maneuvered to outflank Beria and Malenkov.

Military and Foreign Policy Reduction in army size; focus on nuclear deterrence. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): major Cold War confrontation. Crimea Transfer (1954) Transferred from RSFSR to Ukrainian SSR. Cause 1 – Economic integration with Ukrainian economy. Cause 2 – Symbolic “gift” marking 300 years since Pereyaslav Treaty. Cause 3 – Administrative convenience within USSR planning system. Khrushchev – Mini Biography Born in 1894; rose through Party ranks in Ukraine and Moscow. Oversaw collectivization under Stalin; later distanced from Stalinist excesses. Premier from 1958–1964; ousted in a party coup. 17. Leonid Brezhnev’s Leadership (1964–1982) Stability and Stagnation Cause 1 – Reaction to Khrushchev’s Volatility: Brezhnev prioritized bureaucratic order. Cause 2 – Institutional Conservatism: Aging leadership focused on maintaining the status quo. Cause 3 – Ideological Rigidity: Reversal of cultural thaw; crackdown on dissent. Economic slowdown, shortages, reliance on oil exports. Wages rose, but productivity and innovation declined. Ukraine Under Brezhnev Heavy investment in industry and infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as a major scientific and military center. Ukrainian dissidents (e.g., Ivan Dziuba, Viacheslav Chornovil) persecuted. Ukrainian Helsinki Group (1976) Monitored Soviet compliance with human rights. Most members imprisoned, exiled, or placed in psychiatric hospitals. Brezhnev – Mini Biography Born in 1906 in Kamianets-Podilskyi region. Rose through Communist Party via Ukrainian connections. General Secretary 1964–1982; died in office. 18.

Galvanized Ukrainian environmental and independence movements. Rise of Ukrainian Independence Movement Rukh (People’s Movement of Ukraine) founded 1989. Massive demonstrations in Kyiv and Lviv. Historians, writers, and former dissidents united behind sovereignty. Gorbachev – Mini Biography Born 1931; reformist Communist with legal background. General Secretary 1985–1991; awarded Nobel Peace Prize. Resigned after failed 1991 coup and USSR dissolution. 19. Collapse of the USSR (1991) Key Causes Cause 1 – Economic Breakdown: Perestroika reforms failed to revive productivity; empty store shelves and unpaid wages became the norm. Cause 2 – Rise of National Movements: The loosening of central control allowed republics like Ukraine, the Baltics, and Georgia to demand sovereignty. Cause 3 – Failed 1991 Coup: An attempted putsch by hardliners in August 1991 discredited Soviet institutions and accelerated demands for independence. Key Events March 17, 1991 Referendum: A majority in Ukraine voted to remain in a reformed USSR, but under the growing influence of Rukh and worsening conditions, attitudes shifted rapidly. US President George H.W. Bush’s Kyiv Visit (August 1, 1991): His “Chicken Kiev” speech cautioned against “suicidal nationalism,” which was widely mocked and rejected by Ukrainians. August 24, 1991: Ukraine declared independence following the failed coup in Moscow. December 1, 1991 Referendum: Over 90% voted for full independence; Leonid Kravchuk elected first president. Belavezha Accords (December 8, 1991): Signed by leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus—formally dissolving the USSR. Consequences Rapid transition to sovereignty without established institutions. Economic collapse and inflation followed independence. Security concerns emerged, especially over nuclear weapons. 20.

Cause 3 – Competing National Identities: Ukraine's nation-building clashed with Russian post-imperial nostalgia. Major Agreements and Conflicts 1994 Budapest Memorandum: Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. In return, the US, UK, and Russia pledged to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Black Sea Fleet Agreement (1997): Russia allowed to lease bases in Sevastopol until 2017. Ukraine received gas discounts and debt relief. Oligarchic Economy Rise of politically connected business magnates. Led to corruption, crony capitalism, and weakened state institutions. Foreign Policy – Multi-vectorism Ukraine balanced relations between Russia and the West. Sought EU integration while maintaining trade with CIS countries. 21. Ukraine’s Western Turn and Putin’s Presidency (2000s–2010s) Orange Revolution (2004–2005) Cause 1 – Election Fraud: Runoff vote between Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych marred by massive fraud. Cause 2 – Civil Society Mobilization: NGOs, students, and journalists organized protests. Cause 3 – Yushchenko’s Poisoning: Galvanized support and international attention.
