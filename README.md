# Text RPG Game Engine

Version: 0.0.0 - Initial Commit

This repository will contain an AI enhanced, text-adventure game engine that will allow users to create open world text adventures with the help of an LLM and play them with features that add more interacitveness and immersion using an LLM. 

## Features
- Open world
- LLM creating immersion by:
    - controlling npcs
    - interpreting commands
    - describing the outcome of actions
    - deciding the consequences of certain actions

## Requirements

NOTE: I hope to one day be able to run the LLM locally, but we'll have to wait for technology to catch up to my dreams for that :(
