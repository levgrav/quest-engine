Core Gameplay
 - Implement text command handling for player movement and actions.
 - Develop AI-driven decision logic for NPC interactions and environmental events.
 - Define combat mechanics (turn-based system with AI-managed time progression).
 - Ensure the notes system is functional (automatic and manual note entries).
 - Create inventory management with side-panel display and equipment functionality.
Data Structures and File Management
 - Finalize world structure with:
 - Nested location directories.
 - Integrated features in location JSON files.
 - Route connections between sub-locations.
 - Standardize player JSON structure (single-file format for attributes, status, inventory, and progress).
 - Create sample game templates to showcase how JSON files are structured.
AI Logic and Interactions
 - Program AI for dynamic content creation (events, NPC behavior, random encounters).
 - Implement AI feedback handling for invalid or ambiguous player input.
 - Design AI decision-making for time progression (e.g., travel time adjustment based on weather).
 - Integrate world state tracking to reflect changes (e.g., burned towns, cleared dungeons).
UI and Panels
 - Implement side panels:
 - Left panel for personal data (attributes, skills, status effects).
 - Right panel for environmental information (time, weather, etc.).
 - Develop command interface for smooth input handling (with AI fallback for invalid commands).
Saving, Loading, and World Continuity
 - Implement save-on-exit functionality (player progress saved automatically).
 - Ensure game-over handling (no reload after character death).
 - Test AI warnings for soft-lock scenarios (e.g., skipping critical quests or events).
Testing and Debugging
 - Test edge-case handling (e.g., interactions with non-existent objects).
 - Add debugging tools to monitor game state and events in real-time.
 - Validate JSON schema to ensure correct data formatting.
Future Enhancements (Optional)
 - Explore multiplayer support for future versions.
 - Consider adding magic systems, factions, or alignment tracking as simple text-based attributes.
 - Plan for optimizations (incremental data loading, safeguards on event generation).
